	abstract = {A systematic study of the preparation of porphyrins with extended conjugation by meso,β-fusion with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is reported. The meso-positions of 5,15-unsubstituted porphyrins were readily functionalized with PAHs. Ring fusion using standard Scholl reaction conditions (FeCl3, dichloromethane) occurs for perylene-substituted porphyrins to give a porphyrin β,meso annulated with perylene rings (0.7:1 ratio of syn and anti isomers). The naphthalene, pyrene, and coronene derivatives do not react under Scholl conditions but are fused using thermal cyclodehydrogenation at high temperatures, giving mixtures of syn and anti isomers of the meso,β-fused porphyrins. For pyrenylsubstituted porphyrins, a thermal method gives synthetically acceptable yields ({\textgreater}30\%). Absorption spectra of the fused porphyrins undergo a progressive bathochromic shift in a series of naphthyl (λmax = 730 nm), coronenyl (λmax = 780 nm), pyrenyl (λmax = 815 nm), and perylenyl (λmax = 900 nm) annulated porphyrins. Despite being conjugated with unsubstituted fused PAHs, the β,mesofused porphyrins are more soluble and processable than the parent nonfused precursors. Pyrenyl-fused porphyrins exhibit strong fluorescence in the near-infrared (NIR) spectral region, with a progressive improvement in luminescent efficiency (up to 13\% with λmax = 829 nm) with increasing degree of fusion. Fused pyrenyl-porphyrins have been used as broadband absorption donor materials in photovoltaic cells, leading to devices that show comparatively high photovoltaic efficiencies.},

              Porphyrin-based frameworks, as specific kinds of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), have been widely used in energy-related conversion processes, including the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and CO

              reduction reaction (CO
              2
              RR), and also in energy-related storage technologies such as rechargeable Zn–air batteries. This review starts by summarizing typical crystal structures, molecular building blocks, and common synthetic procedures of various porphyrin-based frameworks used in energy-related technologies. Then, a brief introduction is provided and representative applications of porphyrin-based frameworks in ORR, OER, Zn–air batteries, and CO
              2
              RR are discussed. The performance comparison of these porphyrin-based frameworks in each field is also summarized and discussed, which pinpoints a clear structure–activity relationship. In addition to utilizing highly active porphyrin units for catalytic conversions, regulating the porous structures of porphyrin-based frameworks will enhance mass transfer and growing porphyrin-based frameworks on conductive supports will accelerate electron transfer, which will result in the improvement of the electrocatalytic performance. This review is therefore valuable for the rational design of more efficient porphyrin-based framework catalytic systems in energy-related conversion and storage technologies.},

There are 4 main signals. The most shielded at -2.713 ppm is attributed to NH protons, due to the electronrich character of the pyrrolic ring. In addition, its absence of multiplicity suggests the absence of hydrogen atoms in neighbouring positions, a condition that is only verified by NH protons in the structure of the target TPP. 
The remaining peaks are all placed in the aromatic reagion. The attributions indicated are based on the idea that the proximity to the porphyrinic ring provides shielding, in order to distinguish b and c positions, and that vinylic protons are more shielded than phenylic ones, in order to attribute the d position.
Finally, it is noted that TMS is found in very close proximity to its expected shift of 0.
