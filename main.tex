% A template for Wiley article submissions developed by 
% Overleaf for the Overleaf-Wiley pilot which ran 
% during 2017 and 2018.
% 
% This template is no longer supported, but is provided
% for historical reference. Last updated January 2019.
%
% Please note that whilst this template provides a 
% preview of the typeset manuscript for submission, it 
% will not necessarily be the final publication layout.
%
% Document class options:
% =======================
% blind: Anonymise all author, affiliation, correspondence
%        and funding information.
%
% lineno: Adds line numbers.
%
% serif: Sets the body font to be serif. 
%
% twocolumn: Sets the body text in two-column layout. 
% 
% num-refs: Uses numerical citation and references style 
%           (Vancouver-authoryear).
%
% alpha-refs: Uses author-year citation and references style
%             (rss).
%
% Using other bibliography styles:
% =======================
%
% To specify a different bibiography style
%
% 1) Do not use either num-refs or alpha-refs in documentclass.
% 2) Load natbib package with the options set as needed.
% 3) Use the \bibliographystyle command to specify the style
% 
% Included NJD styles are: 
%   WileyNJD-ACS
%   WileyNJD-AMA
%   WileyNJD-AMS
%   WileyNJD-APA
%   WileyNJD-Harvard
%   WileyNJD-VANCOUVER
%
% or you may upload an alternative .bst file 
% (if requested by the journal).
%
% Examples:
% =======================
%% Example: Using numerical, sort-by-authors citations.
\documentclass[num-refs]{wiley-article}

%% Example: Using author-year citations and anonymising submission
% \documentclass[blind,alpha-refs]{wiley-article}

%% Example: Using unsrtnat for numerical, in-sequence citations

\usepackage[super]{natbib}
\bibliographystyle{WileyNJD-AMA}
% \makeatletter
% \renewcommand{\@biblabel}[1]{#1.}

\section{Introduction}
Porhyrins represent an obiquitous class of molecules that plays a crucial role biochemistry for oxygen transport\cite{hardison_evolution_2012}, storage\citep{kendrew_three-dimensional_1958} and catalysis as well as electron transfer\citep{keilin_cytochrome_1925}.\\
Therefore, extensive efforts have been put into the exploration of the functionalities obtainable by artificially synthesized porphyrins.\\
The biomimetic electrocatalysis\cite{facchin_oxygen_2021}\cite{liang_porphyrin-based_2021} and cancer treatment and diagnosis\cite{wang_recent_2021} represent two outstanding examples among all the use cases in which porphyrins have been successfully deployed.
Numerous works elaborate the further functionalization of \textit{meso}-tetraphenylporphyrin\cite{silva_porphyrins_2006} in order to realize functional materials.
However, to date the scale up in complex porphyrins production and broad commercial application is prevented by the production costs which are primarily led up by the expensiveness of reactants, inefficient and unreliable synthesis.
In the following work, a simple synthesis route for 5,10,15,20-mesotetraphenylporhyrin is detailed and its products are critically discussed.
