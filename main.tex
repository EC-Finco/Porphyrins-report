\section{Introduction}

Porhyrins represent an obiquitous class of molecules that plays a crucial role biochemistry for oxygen transport\citep{hardison_evolution_2012}, storage\citep{kendrew_three-dimensional_1958} and catalysis as well as electron transfer\citep{keilin_cytochrome_1925}.\\
Therefore, extensive efforts have been put into the exploration of the functionalities obtainable by artificially synthesized porphyrins.\\
The biomimetic electrocatalysis\cite{facchin_oxygen_2021,liang_porphyrin-based_2021} and cancer treatment and diagnosis\cite{wang_recent_2021} represent two outstanding examples among all the use cases in which porphyrins have been successfully deployed.
Numerous works elaborate the further functionalization of \textit{meso}-tetraphenylporphyrin\cite{silva_porphyrins_2006} in order to realize functional materials. \\
However, to date the scale up in complex porphyrins production and broad commercial application is prevented by the production costs which are primarily led up by the expensiveness of reactants, inefficient and unreliable synthesis.
In the following work, a simple synthesis route for 5,10,15,20-mesotetraphenylporhyrin is detailed and its products are critically discussed either for the \texorpdfstring{H\textsubscript{2}}-TPP and the metallated Zn-TPP.

\section{Methods}

        \label{reaction}
\end{figure*}
The synthesis proposed for \textit{meso}-tetraphenylporphyrin is a multistep electrophilic aromatic substitution between the electrophilic carboxilic group of protonated benzaldehyde on the aromatic ring of pyrrole which is summarized in Fig.\ref{reaction}.
The protonation of benzaldehyde implies that the reaction is performed in acidic environment, and its protonated form is stabilized by the resonance forms reported in Fig.\ref{res-benz}.\\

        \label{mechanism}
    \end{subfigure}
\end{figure*}
This route is called Rothemund synthesis and proceeds through the repetition of the six steps in Fig.\ref{mechanism} thanks to the driving force provided by the stability of the wide aromatic system.
The reaction consists in multiple condensations occurring at the addition of each unit to the porhyrinic ring.
The first step consist in the electrophylic attack of the protonated aldehyde to the pyrrolic ring.
Then, the pyrrolic ring extracts the positive charge and gets deprotonated in the second step.
The re-protonation of the carbonilic group by the acidic environment forms the leaving group -OH$_{2}$$^{+}$ which causes the condensation of the reagents and the relocaliization of the positive charge on the nitrogen atom by the misplacing of its lone pair into the pyrrolic ring.
The methynic bridge is instaurated by the electrophyle attack of the insaturated bond and the concerted relocation of the positive charge into the newly added pyrrolic ring.

The metallation of the free base porhyrin is operated by the reaction in reflux conditions with zinc acetate as reported in Fig. \ref{metalation}.
\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Zn-TPP reaction}
    \caption{Reaction scheme for the metallation of the free base porphyrin.}
    \label{metalation}
\end{figure*}
The use of chloroform is necessary for the solvation of the freebase porphyrin, while methanol solvates the zinc acetate.
The metallation of the free base porphyrin is allowed by its deprotonation which is allowed by the basic behaviour of the acetate anion.
Then, the Zn(II) cation is coordinated by the four nitrogen atoms.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%RESULTS AND DISCUSSION%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Results and Discussions}
In the following section, the characterization results are presented and discussed for both, the free base and the metallated porphyrin.
\subsection{\textit{In situ} characterizations}
The reactions were monitored using Thin Layer Chromatography.
In Fig. \ref{tlc-h2tpp} it is possible to see that the reaction already had occurred by the time of the first control, which corresponds to around 5 minutes of reaction time.
This can be affirmed since the control TLC performed after 30 minutes of reaction time also against a commercial standard, exhibited the same features.
It must be noted that the R$_{f}$ of the tested samples appear to shift to higher values.
The reason of which might be found in two possible phenomena, namely the change in eluent composition due to higher vapor pressure of petroleum ether compared to methanol and the excessive eluent run that was performed on the second plate.
Indeed, the fact that the second plate had the eluent almost to its edge might have caused a distortion of the R$_{f}$ in excess.
In the meanwhile, the instability in composition of the eluent might explain the shift in relative differences of the R$_{f}$ coefficients between benzaldehyde and pyrrole, since their difference in R$_{f}$ changes from 14\% to 9\%.

At the end of the synthesis, the yield was estimated to be 15.3\%, which amounted to the synthesis of 0.339 g of product against the 2.21 g expected if the reaction had been quantitative and limited by pyrrole, the limiting reactant.
The metallation of the free base porphyrin was monitored once again by the use of TLC plates 2, 5 and 25 minutes since the beginning of the reaction.
The results of which can be observed in the Fig.\ref{TLC-Zn-TPP}.\\

\section{Conclusions}
\section{Experimental}
Reagents were loaded in a round-bottomed flask containing 40 mL of propionic acid.
Firstly, the flask was placed in a heating mantle mounted with an Allihn condenser on top and heated to boil the acid.
The reagents, consisting in 1.65 mL (15.75 mmol) of benzaldehyde and 1 mL of pyrrole (14.4 mmol), were loaded from the upper end of the condenser at the same time to avoid pyrrole polymerization.
Therefore, a small excess of benzaldehyde was used in order to prevent polymerization of the pyrrole into polypyrrole \\
Following, the condenser's walls were wahed with 10 mL of propionic acid to ensure quantitative transfer of the reagents to the flask.
The reaction was driven in reflux conditions for 30 minutes and was monitored through TLC at the beginning and after 30 minutes of reflux.
All the TLCs were performed using as eluent a solution of petroleum ether and ethyl acetate in 3:1 volumetric ratio.
A purple precipitate formed in the flask and upon cooling it was filtered from the solvent.
The filtration was performed using a gootch sieve with a porosity of 3 mounted on Buchner flask connected to a vacuum line.
Subsequently, the solid was washed from propionic acid using methanol, due to the higher volatility of the latter.
The purple crystals, which can be seen in Fig.\ref{pic-tpp}, were removed from the porous sieve with a spatula and transferred into a vial which had been previously weighted.
The product was weighted through the use of a digital scale in order to estimate the reaction yield and a TLC was performed against a commercial standard to ensure successful synthesis.\\

\break
The metallation of the as-synthesized porphyrin was realized on 200 mg of the sample.
The intermediate product was weighted on a watch glass and then trasferred into a round-bottomed flask alongside with 20 mL of chloroform and heated using a heating mantle.
A volume of 4 mL of a saturated solution of zinc acetate in methanol was then added to the flask and reflux conditions were imposed using an Allihn condenser for 30 minutes.
Also this reaction was monitored through TLC of H$_{2}$-TPP, the starting solution and the reaction solution after 2, 5 and 25 minutes after mixing the reagents.
In order to avoid the streaking of the spots, the samples from the reaction solution were diluted in chloroform before placing on the TLC plate.\\
\break
At this point, the purification of Zn-TPP is needed in order to separate the product from zinc acetate precursor.
This is achieved through the employment of a separating funnel and use of water as the extracting phase for zinc acetate.
The separation was repeated twice using each time 20 mL of milliQ water.
Furthermore, anhydrification of the chloroform containing Zn-TPP was undertaken by the addition of abundant Na$_{2}$SO$_{4}$ powder.
The sodium sulfate is added until the newly added powder stops aggregating, testifying the lack of water.
The insoluble powder has been filtered from the organic solvent using a paper filter folded to fit in a funnel.
The filtered liquid, containing dissolved Zn-TPP, was collected in a 100 mL round-bottomed flask.
Ultimately, the flask was placed in a rotavapor system to evaporate the solvent and enable the collection of the solid product.
The reaction yield was again estimated by the use of a digital scale and the product was transferred into a vial before undergoing the analysis described ....
