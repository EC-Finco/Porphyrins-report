# Coursework on TPP synthesis and metallation
This repo is used as a version control for the writing and for storing the information related to the lab experience that I've done as part of the MSc in Materials Science at University of Padova. <br />
The report is written on the Wiley template for original papers, which can be downloaded at the [link](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/wiley-journal-template/nnjcnfyhzcqp). <br />
The available dataset consists in a collection of [pictures](https://photos.app.goo.gl/iz8Uq2QUgXTqpMkTA) and the laboratory [notebook, from page 10](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dqf5EHy--bS9fJDR-YzxN4ehRHHdMIRq/view?usp=sharing).
